In this project i want to share my work for the Mazda RX8 information diplay and the parts that connected to it.

I started the project while working on a "remake" for the navigation unit. Basiclly i want to replace the OEM Navigation unit with an own programmed display where u can see sensors and also troubleshoot your car for example a DTC read out.

Some information in the project i got from already dead github projects. So i will try to continue there work :) Also i alredy want to say thanks to these poeple who was able to help me with there information! 


Currently there wont be much in this Project cause im currently planing on desinging a PCB where everthing will connect.
